## Automatic filename/extension on save

1.  If you use Ctrl+S to save, it will simply work (Recommended).
2.  If you do File > Save As > Browse, it will also simply work.
3.  However, if you just do File > Save As, and then save it to OneDrive (The default) then you'll have to specify .xlsm (Macro-Enabled) as the file extension, or you'll get a warning.  If you choose to ignore the warning and save it as .xlsx anyway, that's probably fine if you're already done with the calibration.  The macros will be stripped from this copy, but all your data is already present and validated, so that should be fine, too.
